👋 Hi, I'm Tithi! I have developed a strong foundation in Data science and a passion for using data to uncover meaningful insights. I am excited to bring my technical and analytical skills to the field of data science as an entry-level data specialist.

During my training and certification courses, I honed my ability to work with complex data and developed a keen eye for identifying patterns and trends. I also gained experience in data management, and statistical analysis, which I believe will be valuable assets in my role as a data specialist.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring new data analysis tools and techniques, and I am always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. Whether working on a team or independently, I am driven by the thrill of discovering new insights and the satisfaction of using data to solve complex problems.

Here's my CV in [PDF] (https://github.com/rhtithi/rhtithi/blob/main/Data%20Analyst%20Resume%2C%20Tithi.pdf)
This is a repository to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Analytics / Data Science related topics.
